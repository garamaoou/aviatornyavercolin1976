### Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

Aviator is a simple yet engaging game that revolves around a plane\'s
flight, with the goal of cashing out before the plane flies away. The
game is unique because it's based on a multiplier system that grows as
long as the plane is in the air.

#### How the Game Works:

-   Players place a bet before the round starts.
-   Once the round begins, a plane starts to take off.
-   As the plane flies, a multiplier increases, and players can cash out

    flies away before cashing out, the bet is lost.

#### Tips to Play Aviator:

-   **Betting strategies**: Start with smaller bets and gradually
    increase as you understand the game\'s volatility.
-   **Auto Cashout Feature**: Set a target multiplier to automatically
    cash out your winnings.

    which can give insights into the game's flow.
